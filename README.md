# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is simple web app built to thrill.  Users can play the classic game
with a modern twist (and a mexican-restaurant themed color scheme).

## Approach

My approach was to keep this a simple as possible.  I began with setting up the
HTML and add some simple CSS.  After that, I delved into the game logic which
took much longer than expected.  I finished the game logic in time to start
working on the AJAX for the forms, but did not have a chance to work on the
game state.

## Technology
I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, and AJAX in this project.  I
especially enjoyed the CSS.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to register so that I can play the game.
2. As a user, I want to be able to update my password so I can maintain security
of my account.
3. As a user, I want to be able to log in and out so I can return to the site to
play more games.
4. As a user, I want to be able to see how many games I have won so I can track
my progress.
5. As a user, I want to play against a friend so that I have a better user experience.
6. As a developer, I want to write code that is functional and readable so that the
product is usable.
7. As a developer, I want to maintain a development schedule so that the project is
finished on time.



## Obstacles

The main obstacle I ran into doing this project was simply time.  The javascript
for the game logic took much longer than I expected and ultimately, kept me from
completing the requirements.  If I had extra time, I would have liked to continue
working on the CSS and flesh out the Mexican restaurant theme.  The game would
be called Tic Tac Taco and the background would have a taco pattern.  It would both
excite users and make them hungry.

## Future Development

For future projects, I will invest more time in the project - staying late more
nights in order to take advantage of the consultants' help.  I also think it would
be helpful to work within a group rather than on my own.  Ultimately, I'm very proud
of my javascript and the AJAX for the forms and that is what I will take away
from this project.
